# About My Pretty Neighbor

**My Pretty Neighbor** was created for our university assignment. It is a retro PSX-inspired horror game where you play as a young man returning to his parents’ house after their passing. Upon coming back, the condominium feels strangely eerie and unsettling. The game takes inspiration from classics like Silent Hill and Resident Evil 4, featuring strong survival-horror elements.

Location in this game was inspired by an actual condonium where one of my team members lived so it had that personal scary vibe lol since we modelled it.
