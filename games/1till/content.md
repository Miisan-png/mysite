# About My Pretty Neighbor

**1 Till Midnight** was created for UM Game Jam 2024, developed in under 48 hours. You play as a local 11 Eleven convenience store worker trapped in a nightmare filled with your character’s fears. The theme was 4th wall break, so the game scares the player by revealing their real computer information in-game.
This concept ultimately won us First Place!
