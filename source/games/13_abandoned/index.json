A game created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 22, about a cloned astronaut stuck alone on a space station, trying to escape. Very simplistic game at this point, but I fully intend to develop it further over time and add more levels and mechanics.

The game ended up getting 2nd Place out of over 700 games in the competition.
