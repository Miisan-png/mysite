Centuries after a mysterious cataclysm tore the world apart, humans have taken to the skies - ferrying their kin in airships, searching the remains for artifacts and survivors. Explorer NÃ©voa ventures out across uncharted islands, left floating in the sky. Alone and armed only with a shovel, she is determined to carve her own path.
