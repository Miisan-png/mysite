I started Leap 4 Blue way back in May or something, for the Winnipeg TIGJam. Create platforms to leap your way to blue, avoiding lasers, enemies, and an assortment of hazards and puzzles.<br />
<a href="http://www.liamberry.bandcamp.com">Liam Berry</a> and <a href="http://infiniteammo.ca/">Alec Holowka</a> wrote the music in the game, and <a href="http://achroware.com/">Broxter</a> gave it <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Broxter/status/15128574217">its name</a>.
