	"description": "Pixel Switch is a small game with 12 levels I created in 2 days. The thing about the game is that you can't jump. Instead you are able to flip the gravity 180 degrees at any time by pressing X.<br />Coincidentally, this game is pretty similar to Terry Cavanagh's VVVVVV (which is way better and you should all go check out if you haven't)",
