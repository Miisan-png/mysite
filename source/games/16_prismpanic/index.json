Created with my friend <a href="http://connorullmann.com/">Connor Ullmann</a>, Prism Panic is a platformer about overlapping worlds with holes between them. Each world has different mirrored traits, creating some interesting puzzles and platforming. Was a lot of fun to make. The music was done by <a href="http://liamberry.bandcamp.com/">Liam Berry</a>, with a single boss battle theme by <a href="http://infiniteammo.ca/">Alec Holowka</a>
