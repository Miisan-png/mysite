	"description": "My brother, Liam and I made this game over about 3 or 4 months for a Game Maker competition. At the time it was by far the most polished game we had made. Pretty proud of it at the time. I think we were 13 and 15 when we made it. Liam made all the art and music, and I programemed it. Fun times.",
