	"description": "Pixel Runner was originally created for a 3 hour competition, meaning the game was created in just 3 hours. You basically run around and try to dodge the different objects and hazards that come running at you. I got some great responses to this simplistic game, and I was quite proud of it when I first created it in 2008.",
