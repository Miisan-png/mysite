	"description": "Red 'N Blue is a platform puzzle game, where you control two players, but only one at a time. You must get both Red and Blue to the Green exit door, avoiding traps, hazards, etc. The game has a bit of a twist, to make the game a little more challenging. Red cannot touch anything Blue, other than Blue himself, and Blue cannot touch anything Red, other than Red herself.",
