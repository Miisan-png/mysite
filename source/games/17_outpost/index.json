Game I created over 48 hours for the <a href="http://iamagamer.ca/">iamagamer jam</a>.<br /><br />
I've since created a much larger post-jam version, which can be downloaded below, though this isn't a finished version.<br />
You will need the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=20914">XNA redistributable</a> installed.<br /><br />
